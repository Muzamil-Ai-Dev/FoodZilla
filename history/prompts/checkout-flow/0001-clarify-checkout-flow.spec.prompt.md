# Prompt
The user followed up to "continue". I identified the `checkout-flow` as the next feature and read its specification.

# Response Summary
Analyzed the checkout flow requirements and posed three clarifying questions regarding single-restaurant constraints, state persistence, and form validation to ensure the implementation aligns with expectations.

# Outcome
Feature requirements are reviewed. Clarification is pending from the user before planning begins.
