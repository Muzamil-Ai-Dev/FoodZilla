# Prompt
The user followed up to "continue". I performed a final cleanup of the specification and plan files to reflect the 100% completion of the project.

# Response Summary
Synchronized all `spec.md` and `plan.md` files with the actual implementation status by marking all criteria and tasks as completed. The project is now in a perfect "Green" state across both code and documentation.

# Outcome
All project documentation is up to date. The system is ready for the next iteration or a new feature set.
